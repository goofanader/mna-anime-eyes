Anime Eyes: Watered-Down Version for Officers
Created 9/26/2014 by Phyllis Douglas (goofanader@gmail.com)
Version: 0.5.0

Requirements:
This program has only been tested on Windows x64 machines. I give no guarantees for any other OSes/variations.

How to start:
Place the images that you want to view in the folder "C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\MnA_Anime_Eyes\images"
If there's no folder of that available, run the program once, and it should create the folders for you (if it doesn't, please let me know).

Open the program. You'll probably want to go into fullscreen: press 'f' to do so. Then, press ']' when you're ready to begin.

How to run:
Press ']' when someone gets the image correct. It'll show the image in its true glory. Press ']' again to continue to the next image.

If nobody gets the image by the time it's clear, press ']' to go the next image.

Controls:
r - reload the images in the image folder
f - enter/exit fullscreen for the monitor the program's located on
] - makes the image clear. press again to go to the next image
[ - makes the image clear. press again to go to the previous image
esc or q - quit the game

Notes:
* This version is hardcoded to have a beginning pixel size of 100
* This version is hardcoded to have a time limit of 18 seconds per image

To-Do:
- a pause button
- smooth out the image so it shrinks/increases nicely
- keep the pixel size consistent to screen width, not image size

Updates:
10/25/2014:
- can go to previous image
- load and reload images from an external folder

9/26/2014:
- initial creation
- can go to next image
- pictures were hardcoded into the program
- pixel size set to 70 for Day 1
