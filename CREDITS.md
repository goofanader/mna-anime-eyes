* Original program: [ShippoSearch by Nur Monson](https://github.com/samiamwork/ShippoSearch)

    Most of this program's functionality is based off of ShippoSearch and trying to replicate it. The image pixelation used in ShippoSearch is from a Mac OSX library, so I had to try and replicate it using shaders...
